description: Append a structured decision entry to .logs/decisions.md. Invoke whenever you have made a non-trivial implementation or design choice that requires an audit trail — a spec deviation, an ambiguity resolution, a technology selection, or a trade-off.

## Protocol

1. **Read `.logs/decisions.md`** to find the highest existing decision ID. IDs follow the pattern `DEC-NNN` (zero-padded to three digits). If the file does not exist, create it with this header:
   ```
   # Decision Log
   ```

2. **Assign the next sequential ID.** Decision IDs are sequential across the whole project — not per-agent. If the highest existing ID is `DEC-014`, assign `DEC-015`. If the file is empty or newly created, start at `DEC-001`.

3. **Read `logs/decision-log-format.md`** to confirm the current required fields and structure before writing.

4. **Append the entry.** Write the complete decision entry. Every required field must be present — do not omit any field because it seems obvious or redundant. The Context field must be written for a PM reader, not an engineer — use plain language and avoid unexplained jargon.

5. **Return the assigned decision ID** (`DEC-NNN`) to the calling context so it can be referenced in activity log entries, handoff summaries, and completion artifacts.

## Rules

- Never modify or delete existing entries. The decision log is append-only.
- Never renumber existing entries.
- The "Options considered" field must contain at least two options. If there was genuinely only one option, the situation was a constraint — record it in the activity log's "Assumptions made" field instead, not here.
- "PM/Tech Lead review required: Yes" must be set for any decision involving scope, cost, compliance, availability targets, or user-facing behavior the PM may have a view on.
- If `.logs/` does not exist, create the directory before writing.
- If you are logging multiple decisions in one session, assign IDs sequentially in the order they are logged.
